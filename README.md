Violence detection using pre-trained models involves using machine learning models that have already been trained on large datasets to recognize patterns associated with violent actions or behaviors. These models can be applied to CCTV footage, video surveillance, or image streams to identify threats in real-time. By utilizing pre-trained models, you can significantly reduce the time and resources required for training, leveraging the generalization power of these models.
